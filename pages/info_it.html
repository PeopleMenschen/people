                    An operating system (OS) is a software program that acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and user applications. It manages computer hardware resources, provides a user interface, and facilitates communication between software applications and the hardware components of a computer system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hardware Management: The OS manages the computer's hardware resources, including the CPU, memory (RAM), storage devices (hard drives, SSDs), input/output devices (keyboard, mouse, monitor), and network connections.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Process Management: The OS oversees the execution of software programs, known as processes, by allocating system resources, scheduling tasks, and managing process states (e.g., running, waiting, terminated).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Memory Management: The OS controls system memory to ensure efficient allocation and deallocation of memory resources, including managing virtual memory, memory paging, and memory allocation for processes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    File System Management: The OS provides mechanisms for organizing and storing files on storage devices, managing file access permissions, and facilitating file operations such as creation, deletion, reading, and writing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Device Management: The OS interacts with hardware devices by providing device drivers and managing device access and communication between software applications and hardware peripherals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    User Interface: The OS provides a user interface (UI) that allows users to interact with the computer system, perform tasks, and run applications. User interfaces may include command-line interfaces (CLI), graphical user interfaces (GUI), or a combination of both.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In summary, an operating system is a fundamental software component that enables computers to perform tasks, manage hardware resources, run software applications, and provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the system.

                    Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (the cloud) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. In essence, cloud computing enables users to access and use computing resources and services on-demand without the need for direct management of physical infrastructure. Users typically pay only for the resources they consume, making cloud computing a cost-effective and scalable solution for individuals, businesses, and organizations.
