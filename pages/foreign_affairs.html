                    The cultural system refers to the complex and interconnected network of beliefs, values, norms, symbols, traditions, customs, rituals, arts, and practices that characterize a particular society or community.

                </p>
                <h3>Traditions and Rituals:</h3>
                <p>
                    Traditions are long-established customs, practices, and rituals passed down from generation to generation within a cultural community.

                <p>

                    Cultural identity refers to the sense of belonging, affiliation, and attachment that individuals and groups feel toward their cultural heritage, traditions, and community. Cultural diversity encompasses the variety of cultural identities, traditions, languages, and practices present within a society or across different societies, reflecting the richness, complexity, and interconnectedness of human experiences and expressions worldwide.
